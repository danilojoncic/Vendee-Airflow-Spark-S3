https://github.com/danilojoncic/Vendee-Globe-Spark-S3 for S3 cluster and Spark master with 2 workers
https://github.com/danilojoncic/Vendee-Globe-Data-Analysis for pure python/pandas implementation with just docker compose for infrastructure and orchestration (far fetched), this repo's README has the most comprehensive explanation of the project and the desired outcome
